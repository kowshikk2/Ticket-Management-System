# Ticketing-Application

## Description
In this app, users can login, create work tickets and then view, edit and delete these tickets. Work tickets can also be assigned to different users. Users with the Administrator or Manager title can create new users(Employee title by default), suspend a user's ability to log into the app and delete users.

The backend was built with MongoDB, Express and Node, with authentication and authorization being handled by jwt and security with bcrypt. The front end was built with React and React-Redux. Data fetching was handled using RTK Query.
